        <h1>SUGGESTIONS AND PRECAUTIONS</h1>
        <div class="text">
            <p>Skin infections are caused by the growth of bacteria or microorganisms just under the skin and enter through minor injuries such as cuts, scrapes and blisters. In general, these infections remain fairly mild and can often be cured by topical solutions. However, there are cases where skin infections can become increasingly painful and dangerous, especially if left untreated.</p>
            <h2>How To Tell If A Rash Needs Medical Attention?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>If the rash is growing rapidly or if you have rashes all over your body</li>
                <li>If you have a fever with the rash</li>
                <li>If you notice any oozing or development of bumps/inflammation on or around the rash</li>
                <li>If the rash is painful</li>
                <li>If the rash is oozing colored liquids and is infected</li>
                <li>If you experience any of these, book an appointment with your dermatologist.</li>
            </ul>
