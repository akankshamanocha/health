        <h1>SUGGESTIONS AND PRECAUTIONS</h1>
        <div class="text">
            <p>A fever means your body’s fighting a cold, the flu, or another infection. But you can help make the battle as easy as possible. To manage your fever, try these tips:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><p><b>When you first notice it, rest:</b> Being active makes your body heat rise. When you’ve got a fever, activity brings your body temperature up even higher. Help your body recover – and avoid becoming dehydrated or getting heatstroke – by taking it easy until your fever comes down.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Remember to drink, lots:</b> Sweating is your body’s natural cooling system, so staying well hydrated is extra-important.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Eat healthy foods:</b> Nutrients and fluids can help boost your immune system – and the healthier you are when you have a fever, the quicker you'll get over it.</p></li>
                <li><p><b>Medicines:</b> Taking acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil). You can purchase medicines online.</p></li>
                <li><p>Making sure the room temperature where the person is resting is comfortable. Taking a regular bath or a sponge bath using lukewarm water.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Also, make sure to wash your hands often – it can help you avoid colds, flu and the fevers that might come with them. Try to keep your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth, too.</p>

                <h2>When to see a doctor about a fever</h2>
                <p>A mild fever can typically be treated at home. In some cases, however, a fever can be a symptom of a serious medical condition that requires prompt treatment.</p>
                <p><h3>You should take your infant to a doctor if they’re:</h3></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>younger than 3 months old and have a temperature exceeding 100.4°F (38°C)</li>
                    <li>between 3 and 6 months old, have a temperature over 102°F (38.9°C), and seem unusually irritable, lethargic, or uncomfortable</li>
                    <li>between 6 and 24 months old and have a temperature higher than 102°F (38.9°C) that lasts longer than one day</li>
                </ul>

                <br>
                <h3>You should call your doctor if you:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>have a body temperature exceeding 103°F (39.4°C)</li>
                    <li>have had a fever for more than three days</li>
                    <li>have a serious medical illness or a compromised immune system</li>
                    <li>have recently been in a developing country</li>
                </ul>

                <br>
                <h3>You or your child should also see a doctor as soon as possible if a fever is accompanied by any of the following symptoms:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>a severe headache</li>
                    <li>throat swelling</li>
                    <li>a skin rash, especially if the rash gets worse</li>
                    <li>sensitivity to bright light</li>
                    <li>a stiff neck and neck pain</li>
                    <li>persistent vomiting</li>
                    <li>listlessness or irritability</li>
                    <li>abdominal pain</li>
                    <li>pain when urinating</li>
                    <li>muscle weakness</li>
                    <li>trouble breathing or chest pain</li>
                    <li>confusion</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Your doctor will probably perform a physical examination and medical tests. This will help them determine the cause of the fever and an effective course of treatment.</p>
